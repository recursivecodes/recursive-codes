    <h1>About Todd Sharp</h1>
    <div>
        <p>I'm a Developer Advocate for Amazon Interactive Video Service (IVS) at <a href="https://twitch.tv">Twitch</a>. This means that I work with developers around the world to help them integrate live, interactive streaming video into their applications. How do I do that? Well, I create content here on this blog, stream on my <a href="https://twitch.tv/recursivecodes">Twitch channel</a>, post videos on my <a href="https://youtube.com/c/recursivecodes">YouTube channel</a> - all kinds of different places! I also speak at a lot of developer events, so if you see me out and about, feel free to introduce yourself and tell me what you're building! I love to learn about what developers are working on and the tools they are using! I love technology, gaming, travel, and spending time with my wife, kids and our small army of animals (we own a pig - no, seriously!). If you'd like to connect with me, check out my socials down in the footer, or shoot me a line via my contact form.</p>
